## Introduction

This project covers a wide range of topics, including component creation, state management, routing, form handling, calling backend services, authentication, and deployment. The main aim is to provide a hands-on experience in building a real-world application with React.

## Features

- Build and deploy fast and interactive React apps
- Create reusable components
- Implement tables and lists with pagination, sorting, and searching
- Create forms with validation
- Implement routing with React Router
- Call HTTP services with Axios
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Log and handle errors effectively
- Utilize Function Components and Hooks
- Share data using React Context
- Deploy applications to Heroku
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use shortcuts to write more code in less time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>=12.x)
- npm (>=6.x) or yarn (>=1.x)
- MongoDB (for backend services)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vidly.git
    cd vidly
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the backend:
    - Follow the instructions in the `backend` directory to set up and run the Node.js backend service.
    - Make sure MongoDB is running and the backend service is connected to it.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Course Topics

The following topics are covered in the course and implemented in the Vidly project:

- **React Basics**: Setting up the development environment, creating your first React app, custom configurations, and understanding full-stack architecture.
- **Components**: Creating class and function components, passing data and children, managing state and lifecycle methods.
- **Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting**: Building reusable components for handling pagination, filtering, and sorting data.
- **Routing**: Implementing navigation with React Router, including nested routes, redirects, and programmatic navigation.
- **Forms**: Handling form submissions, validations using Joi, and creating reusable form components.
- **Calling Backend Services**: Using Axios to interact with backend services, handling HTTP requests, and managing optimistic and pessimistic updates.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing user registration, login, JWT storage, protecting routes, and managing user permissions.
- **Deployment**: Preparing the application for deployment, using environment variables, deploying to Heroku, and setting up MongoDB in the cloud.
